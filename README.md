This repository contains the scripts used in the project **Protected Areas Multispecies Connectivity** for the Montérégie region conducted for Environment and Climate Change Canada.

### Project objective 
The project aims to develop a land use change (LULC) model to support the expansion of the existing protected areas network in the Montérégie region. Using scenario analyses, the LULC model will contrast alternative protected areas planning processes that include and exclude consideration of multi-species connectivity (focusing on 14 target vertebrate species). Through simulated land use change for different scenarios for
protection, the results will evaluate the effectiveness of multi-species connectivity approaches for the design of protected areas networks that maintain connectivity in the long-term.
